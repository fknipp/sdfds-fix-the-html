      <pre>
      * Celebrating parties with thousands of friends
      * Visiting all countries around the globe

Hike in a lonely valley   My partner       Next year
Play an instrument        Alone            Next month
Drink a cool beer         My best friend   Now
      </pre>

    <!-- Really? -->
    <foot>
      <!-- This should be a heading of 2nd order -->
      <heading2>About me</heading2>
      <p>
        <!-- The part between the asterisks should be bold. -->
        I am in search of my dreams. **The bigger, the better.**
